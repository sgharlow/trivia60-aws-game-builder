Tech Stack Summary:
This solution utilizes Devvit, a toolset for developing interactive applications directly within Reddit. The backend is built using Node.js with TypeScript, ensuring compatibility with Reddit’s API and Devvit components. The frontend is implemented through Devvit UI, which allows for rendering content inside a Reddit post via the web-view-post template. Data for the application is stored in Firebase, which offers a real-time NoSQL database, cloud functions for backend logic, and easy integration with the frontend. This stack ensures seamless communication between Reddit, the backend, and the storage while providing real-time updates and scalability.

Gameplay and Mechanics Summary:
Welcome to the Reddit Daily Trivia Challenge, a fast-paced and engaging game that puts your knowledge of Reddit's hottest and trending topics to the test. Every day, players are presented with 10 fresh trivia questions drawn from the latest buzz across Reddit. These questions cover a wide array of topics, from viral memes and subreddit lore to breaking news and internet culture. The goal is simple: answer as many questions as possible, as quickly as possible, while avoiding the use of hints to climb the leaderboard and earn the ultimate bragging rights.
Each question is presented in a multiple-choice format with four possible answers. Players have 30 seconds to select their answer, with points awarded based on correctness and response speed. For every question, there are two optional hints—a brief text-based clue and an image hint—available at the player’s discretion. However, using hints comes at a cost: a reduction in the score for that question. The faster you answer without relying on hints, the higher your score.
Hints are carefully designed to nudge players toward the correct answer without giving it away outright. For instance, a text hint might reference a popular subreddit discussion or a witty comment, while an image hint could showcase a meme or infographic related to the topic. Hints can be activated with a simple button click, ensuring they’re available if you’re stuck, but their impact on scoring ensures strategic gameplay.
The game is social at its core, taking full advantage of Reddit’s inherent community features. A dynamic leaderboard showcases the top players daily, weekly, and monthly, with scores based on three factors: the number of correct answers, response speed, and avoidance of hints. Players can compete individually or represent their favorite subreddits in friendly rivalry. Leaderboard rankings and achievements are visible to all, encouraging competition and camaraderie.
At the end of each daily session, players can review their performance, see the correct answers, and explore additional context for each question. This feature not only enhances learning but also encourages players to revisit related subreddits and discussions, driving engagement across Reddit. Badges and streak rewards add an extra layer of motivation, recognizing players for consistency, streaks of correct answers, and mastery of certain topics.
The Reddit Daily Trivia Challenge is designed to be inclusive and fun for all Redditors, from casual browsers to hardcore community members. With its blend of timely topics, strategic gameplay, and a competitive edge, it creates an exciting and interactive way to stay connected to the pulse of Reddit
